Asthma, a chronic respiratory condition characterised by airway inflammation and narrowing, is a major global health issue, affecting millions worldwide. This disease is particularly prevalent in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where it contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality due to under-diagnosis and inadequate treatment. In Zimbabwe, a typical LMIC, asthma management is hindered by limited healthcare infrastructure, a shortage of trained medical personnel, and inadequate access to diagnostic tools. Addressing these challenges is critical, as early diagnosis and appropriate management are essential to improving health outcomes. This study explores the potential of machine learning (ML) models to enhance asthma diagnosis in Zimbabwe, thereby offering a scalable solution to bridge diagnostic gaps in resource-constrained settings.
